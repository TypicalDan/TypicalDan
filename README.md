<h1>Hi, I'm @TypicalDan.</h1>
I'd say I'm fairly typical.
<h2>What do I do?</h2>
I'm a 2nd year student studying Mechanical Engineering.<br>
I do this sorta code-y stuff in my free time as a bit of a doss about.<br>
I like to repurpose old hardware a lot to use in various aplicatons, so I'm probably fixing some old laptop for god knows what reason.<br>
<h2>What's up with you?</h2>
I like minecraft and DnD a lot.<br>
I love trash isekai anime, for some reason.<br>
I have a dog. His name is pepper. Pictures on a request basis.<br>
