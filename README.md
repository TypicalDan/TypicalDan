<h1>Hi, I'm @TypicalDan.</h1>
I'd say I'm fairly typical.<br>
I'm an Engineer and a jack of all trades when it comes to computing. I've dabbled in coding, pc, console and mobile device repair, coding and 3D modelling<br>
Often, I play <strong>lott</strong> of VR games, and some shooter games<br>
"If it works, it works"<br>
